# Sashimi for Windows

This utility app changes your Slack status if it detects you're in a Teams call.

It's an improvement over similar apps that read your calendar, supporting ad-hoc calls and ones that go over time 🙄

## Usage

Run Sashimi and give it access to your Slack account. Sashimi doesn't read any information or change anything other than your status.

In the preferences window, add a status message that will be shown when you're in a call (or leave the default 🍣). You can optionally choose an emoji by typing its name as indicated. You can use any built-in or custom emoji from your Slack workspace.

Click 'Save' to save your message. Sashimi will continue to run in the background and start up when you sign in.

To change your message again, open the Sashimi app. To stop Sashimi from starting when you sign in, change it in [Settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/change-which-apps-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-9115d841-735e-488d-e749-9ba301d441e6).
